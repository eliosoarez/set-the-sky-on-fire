Perfect. If you want SUNO to really understand the direction, the trick is:

Describe the mood + texture

Describe the vocal tone clearly

Describe the production dynamics

Avoid saying “make it like Allan Rayman – Word of Mouth” directly (AI tools respond better to stylistic description than direct imitation)

Here’s a strong optimized prompt you can copy into SUNO:

SUNO PROMPT:

Dark, sensual alternative rock song with a moody, hypnotic atmosphere. Minimal but gritty production. Deep, intimate male vocal with a low-register, slightly raspy tone — calm but intense, almost whispered in the verses and more powerful in the chorus.

The verses should feel stripped and tense with pulsing bass and subtle guitar textures. The chorus should open up with emotional weight but still stay controlled and cool — not overly pop, not overly polished.

Groovy, steady drum beat with a slow-burning build. Reverb-heavy guitars, atmospheric background textures, slightly cinematic feel. The vocal delivery should feel confident, mysterious, magnetic, and emotionally restrained — similar to dark indie/alternative rock with sensual undertones.

Tempo around 95–105 BPM. Minor key. Brooding, intimate, and dramatic.

Make it feel nocturnal, urban, and emotionally charged.
